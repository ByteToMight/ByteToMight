### 👋 Hi, I’m @ByteToMight

- 👀 I’m interested in AI, AI Automation, ML, and agent-based workflows.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML & AI Engineering on Codecademy.
     Until now, my engagement with AI was mostly surface-level – now I’m building a solid foundation step by step.
     I’m at the beginning of a structured journey – exploring Python, GitHub, Notion, and automation tools like UiPath, Make, n8n, and Zapier.
     I'm interrested in applying these technologies to design smart, automated systems in the future.
      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly AI/automation projects, especially around productivity systems and workflow design.
  
- 📫 How to reach me: via LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/andreasehof) or GitHub messages.
  
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m documenting my learning publicly through the **#100DaysOfAI** challenge to stay accountable and reflect on my progress.
